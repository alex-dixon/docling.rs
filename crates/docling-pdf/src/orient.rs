//! Content-based page-orientation detection for the OCR path (#225).
//!
//! `/Rotate` normalization (see `pdfium_backend::extract_page`) only helps
//! when the rotation is *declared*: a phone photo taken sideways or a sheet
//! fed into the scanner in landscape has `/Rotate 0` and looks upright to the
//! PDF layer, so layout and OCR run on a sideways/upside-down raster and
//! recognize noise — silently. This module detects the raster's own
//! orientation and reports the angle to un-rotate by, composing with the
//! metadata normalization through the same [`PdfPage::unrotate`] machinery.
//!
//! There is no orientation model to run. Instead the recognizer itself is
//! the judge, the classic OSD trick: take the page's text lines, recognize a
//! handful of the widest under each orientation hypothesis, and score each
//! hypothesis by how much confident text falls out. Upright text decodes
//! many characters at high confidence; sideways/upside-down text decodes
//! few, badly. An upright page early-exits after scoring only its own
//! hypothesis, so the common case pays a few small recognition runs; the
//! probe count is capped, so cost does not grow with page density.
//!
//! The lines come from the PP-OCR text detector when it is installed (#571):
//! its boxes are real text runs, which upright read at the confidence a
//! recognizer gives real text, and which rotated with the page into each
//! hypothesis read as the garbage they then are — a clean signal. The
//! projection strips the probe started with (#225) are the fallback without
//! the detector: on a sparse form — fields spread over a baseline,
//! handwriting, stamps, boxes — a strip spans several fields and reads at a
//! confidence no better than garbage, and on 9 of FUNSD's 199 upright forms
//! the vote then went to a rotation, losing most of their text. The decision
//! also asks that the winner read *better*, not merely *more*: a rotated
//! hypothesis must beat 0° in mean confidence by a margin, the "rotated page
//! reads better than the original" check an upright page cannot fail.
//!
//! Scores are deterministic (single-threaded recognition, fixed probe
//! selection), so pinned snapshots stay stable. Failures degrade to "assume
//! upright" — detection must never make a conversion worse than not having
//! run at all. `DOCLING_RS_OCR_ORIENTATION=off` disables the pass;
//! `DOCLING_RS_DEBUG=1` prints per-hypothesis scores.
//!
