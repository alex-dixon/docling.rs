"""Rust-native chunkers — docling's chunking API backed by ``docling::chunker``.

The Rust port of ``docling_core.transforms.chunker`` runs the chunking; this
module mirrors docling's chunker API shape so call sites translate directly::

    from docling_rs import DocumentConverter
    from docling_rs.chunking import HierarchicalChunker, HybridChunker, WindowChunker

    doc = DocumentConverter().convert("report.docx").document

    for chunk in HierarchicalChunker().chunk(doc):          # structure-driven
        print(chunk.meta.headings, chunk.text)

    chunker = HybridChunker(tokenizer="tokenizer.json", max_tokens=256)
    for chunk in chunker.chunk(doc):                         # tokenization-aware
        embed_me = chunker.contextualize(chunk)              # heading path + text

    chunker = WindowChunker(max_words=300, overlap=0.05)     # word-window, no tokenizer
    for chunk in chunker.chunk(doc):                         # docling-rag's window chunker
        embed_me = chunker.contextualize(chunk)              # '# path' line + body

All chunkers **stream**: ``chunk()`` returns a lazy iterator fed by a native
background thread — each chunk is handed to Python as the Rust side produces
it, so the full chunk list is never materialized and the first chunk arrives
before the last one is computed. Abandoning the iterator early (``break``,
``itertools.islice``, dropping the generator) cancels the background chunking;
Ctrl-C interrupts a pending ``next()``.

Differences from docling's ``docling.chunking``:

* ``HybridChunker(tokenizer=...)`` takes a **path to a HuggingFace
  ``tokenizer.json``** (e.g. ``sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2``'s),
  not a tokenizer object — the Rust side loads it with the ``tokenizers``
  crate, so no Python ``transformers`` install is needed. When omitted it
  falls back to ``.models/chunk/tokenizer.json``, the MiniLM tokenizer
  ``scripts/install/download_dependencies.sh`` fetches alongside the ML
  models.
* ``chunk.meta.doc_items`` holds the items' JSON-pointer refs (``"#/texts/12"``)
  rather than resolved item objects.

All chunkers accept any ``docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument`` (or a
plain docling-JSON ``dict``/``str``). Since this package's ``result.document``
*is* a genuine ``DoclingDocument``, docling's own Python chunkers also keep
working on it — these classes are the faster, dependency-free native path.

class _RefMapper:
    """Maps the engine's chunk items back to the caller's document refs.

    The native chunker re-imports the document JSON and numbers items the way
    the engine would *re-export* them — which drifts from the caller's
    document whenever the import is not a perfect round trip (empty items are
    dropped, HTML/DOCX exports come from docling's item tree, PDF layouts
    regroup, inline runs share their paragraph's number). The items still
    arrive in (nearly) reading order with their kind and Markdown text, so
    each is matched against the caller's items walked in the same order
    (``body`` tree; pictures and tables not descended): a table/picture to a
    table/picture, a text to a text item it renders — exactly (``Section 2``
    for ``[Section 2](#section-2)``, ``x`` for ``- x``, empty for ``- ``),
    else by containment. Candidates are the items not yet taken in a window
    from the earliest untaken item (bounded to ``WINDOW`` before the last
    match) to ``WINDOW`` past the last match, earliest first — so an item
    emitted out of tree order (a picture caption the engine places next to
    its picture) neither strands the rest nor goes unmatched. An item the
    engine repeats (docling repeats an oversized item across the chunks it is
    split into) is recognised by its native ref and text and maps to the
    same item again. An item that matches nothing is left out rather than
